IAM Solution Architecture 
==========================

When approaching and IAM (identity and access management) project it is
important to consider the work as creating change within the
organization. In some circumstances the change will be minimal, with
limited impact on resources. In other cases the change will be
significant, impacting both infrastructure and personnel across the
organization. It is highly recommended that a solution architecture for
IAM projects be developed.

Identity management within an enterprise touches virtually all systems
in use within the organization. Systems, in this context, comprise
computer systems that staff use in the performance of their job
responsibilities and physical systems such as a requirement to show a
driver license to gain access to a restricted area.

It is the task of an identity professional to ensure that, wherever and
whenever identity information is used within an enterprise, the
information is collected and used in an properly designed environment
that ensures efficiency, protects privacy and safeguards integrity.
Applying an architectural approach will significantly raise the
likelihood that an IAM project will be completed consistently and
comprehensively with controlled impact on stakeholders.

There are four levels that should be addressed by a solution
architecture and two control topics to be considered:
